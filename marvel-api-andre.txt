Keep us in the loop about what you're building! Use the space below to add or update information about what you're creating with the Marvel Comics API.

Creating a node.js website for an aws devops class that will reach out and pull characters, their description and possibly a picture of their character.  Currently the plan is to only pull 5 charachers.  Then put it on a application load balancer when the url is refreshed the character will likely change as the info will be different within a aurora database where the information will be stored until the project is complete.  Then once complete we will remove all data related to marvel characters and delete the database along with the node.js website
